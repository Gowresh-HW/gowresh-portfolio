    description1: "Hello! My name is Gowresh Rajagopal and I am a Roboticist with a passion (more like an obsession!) for Robotics.",
    description2: "I am currently working as a Full-Stack ROS Developer/Robotics Engineer at Maxbyte Technologies, UAE. I started my career as a Junior Robotics Engineer at Maxbyte Technologies, India. Over the past 5 years I have evolved as a full-stack ROS Developer across multiple mobile robot platforms, specifically focusing on development and deployment of Autonomous Industrial Mobility Vehicles to shopfloor environments. I am also currently pursuing my Masters in Robotics at Heriot-Watt University, Dubai, where I got the opportunity to work on self-driving vehicle as part of my thesis. Other than this I consider myself a bookworm, who not just loves reading books but also likes to buy and maintain a personal library. And if it is not not obvious yet, I am an ardent Potterhead!",
